In the previous exercise, we developed a procedural method
for computing the value of the nth Fibonacci numbers.
This method was really fast, computing the 20899 digit 100,001st Fibonacci sequence almost instantly.

In this exercise, you are going to compute a method that
returns the last digit of the nth Fibonacci number.
