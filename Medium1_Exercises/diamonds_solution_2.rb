=begin
Write a method that displays a 4-pointed diamond in an n x n grid, where n is an
odd integer that is supplied as an argument to the method.
You may assume that the argument will always be an odd integer.
=end
=begin
  Input: Odd Integer
  Outputs: 4-Pointed Diamond

  Explicit Rules/Requirements:
    - May assume that the argument will always be an odd integer

  Implicit Requirements:
    - Will need to center the stars

  Problem Domain:
    - Since this is the second solution:
      - Try to use a counter for iterating through diamond's rows.

  Data Structure:
    - strings
    - integers

  Mental Model:
    Write a method that takes an odd integer, and returns a string representing a
    4-pointed diamond. Try using a counter and a traditional loop structure for this method.
